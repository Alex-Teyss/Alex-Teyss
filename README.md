## Hi there, I'm Alexandre👋

I am a Software Engineer for almost 3 years, I am passionate about data and artificial intelligence, with solid experience in the tech industry acquired during my studies and professional projects. After completing a curriculum in Application Development (level 6 bac+3/4), I decided to resume my studies to specialize in Data & AI Engineering. Starting in October 2024, I will have the opportunity to apply my skills in a company through a work-study program.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Data & IA Skills, also I start a cursus in Data & IA Engineering at Wild Code School. 
- 👯 I’m looking to an internship for October 2024 to master my Data & IA Skills.
